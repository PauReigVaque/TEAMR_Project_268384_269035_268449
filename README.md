## How to run the code

To execute the code, you will need the images from the dataset. Since the dataset is too large, we were unable to upload it directly. Therefore, we recommend visiting the following page: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pritpal2873/multiple-skin-disease-detection-and-classification

which contains the original dataset we used in pur project.

Once you have downloaded the dataset, follow these steps:

  1.  Create a main folder for the project in your Google Drive and place the code there.
  2.  Inside this folder, create another folder called `data` and place the different class folders from the dataset inside it.
  3.  In the code, update the variable `p3_lab` to match the path to your project folder.

After completing these three steps, you should be able to run the code successfully.
